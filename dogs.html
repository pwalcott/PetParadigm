                <h1>Dogs</h1>
                <p>The canis familiaris, or domestic dog, is a very social animal, and owning a dog can have many mutual
                    benefits
                    between both dog and owner. There have been many studies throughout the last couple of centuries
                    citing not only
                    social benefits of having a companion and reduced feelings of loneliness by adopting a dog, but even
                    medical
                    indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. So if you have a dog, it is
                    important to make
                    sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed them, and provide enough opportunities
                    for exercise. In
                    this page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
                    stages of their
                    lives.</p>

    <h2>Diet and Exercise</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/dogdiet.png" alt="dogdiet" style="margin-top: 0;" width="30%" height="30%">
            <div>
                <p>Throughout the lifespan of a dog, there should generally be fewer and fewer meals as your young one
                    matures. First,
                    they should start with being nursed for the first two months. Then, dogs should eat three meals per
                    day when they
                    are about 3-6 months years old, two meals per day when they are 6 months to one year old, and
                    finally one meal per
                    day after they reach one year old. Typically, somewhere between sixty and seventy percent of an
                    adult dog's mass is
                    water. ASPCA says just a 10% decrease in body water can cause illness, and 15% loss can cause
                    death!<br><br>

                    Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their blood, heart, and
                    really every organ
                    healthy. They need to exercise like we do. They need sun and fresh air. The recommended time
                    necessary to qualify as
                    sufficient exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally it is recommended
                    to have at least
                    30-120 minutes of exercise per day! Can you imagine exercising 2 hours per day? Okay, I know that
                    wouldn't bother some
                    of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your
                    dog does not mean they
                    challenge you to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are okay, too!

        <h2>Grooming and Handling</h2>
        <div class="container">

            <div>
                <p>Keeping your furry family member clean is important to the dogâ€™s health. So be sure to brush
                    frequently to reduce the
                    amount of hair that sheds all over the place, and check for insects such as ticks and fleas. And
                    bathe them once in
                    a while! This in itself can be an exercise depending on how strong-willed the dog is. Do make sure
                    though to get ALL
                    of the soap out! If there is any residual soap, it can result in a rash (if the soap is a harsh soap
                    or if the dog
                    is potentially allergic to the chemicals) or matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
                    difficult to
                    remove. As always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you
                    need to be cautious
                    as you carry your dog. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest
                    and the forearm
                    supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms
                    perpendicular to the dog,
                    and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.

                <p>You should ALWAYS consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are
                    typically recommended.
                    Vaccines reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be
                    determined by
                    your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include Bordetella
                    bronchiseptica,
                    Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.

                <p>It is
                    important to provide your dog with plenty of opportunities for socialization, both with people and
                    other
                    dogs. This can be done through walks, playdates, dog parks, or even just spending time in the
                    backyard with your
                    dog. By meeting their social needs, you can help your dog live a happy and healthy life.<br><br>

                    Here are some specific things you can do to meet your dog's social needs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Take your dog for walks on a regular basis.</li>
                    <li>Let your dog play with other dogs in a safe and supervised environment.</li>
                    <li>Invite friends or family over to visit your dog.</li>
                    <li>Take your dog to dog parks or other places where they can meet new people and dogs.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Balls: Balls are a classic dog toy for a reason. They are easy to throw and catch, and they can
                        provide hours of
                        entertainment for dogs of all ages.</li>
                    <li>Rubber toys: Rubber toys are durable and can withstand even the most aggressive chewers. They
                        come in a variety of
                        shapes and sizes, so you can find one that is perfect for your dog's personality.</li>
                    <li>Plush toys: Plush toys are soft and cuddly, and they can provide comfort and companionship for
                        dogs. They are also a
                        good choice for dogs that like to chew, as they are less likely to be swallowed than hard toys.

            <div>
                <p>Traveling with dogs can be a great way to bond with your furry friend and explore new places
                    together. However, it is
                    important to plan ahead and make sure that your dog is comfortable and safe during your travels.
                    Some things to
                    consider when traveling with dogs include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your dog's temperament and health: Some dogs are more suited to travel than others. If your dog
                        is anxious or has health problems, you may want to reconsider traveling with them</li>
                    <li>The mode of transportation: If you are flying with your dog, you will need to check with the
                        airline to see their policies on pets. If you are driving, you will need to make sure that your
                        dog has a safe and comfortable place to ride.</li>
                    <li>Accommodation: Many hotels and vacation rentals do not allow pets. You will need to book a
                        pet-friendly place if you want to bring your dog with you.</li>
